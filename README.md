**WHAT YOU NEED**
###### Learn
- Git commands - In order to familiarize yourself in version control and collaborative coding technique, you'll need to learn git. Git is one of the best so that's why I and many developers around the world choose to use this. You can learn git commands by watching this video

###### Tools
- Git Client - git is a version control system that can cater from small to large organisations, perfect for open-source projects such as this. You can get a client software [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
- Code Editor - Code editors are essential for big projects like this. Here are some of the best code editors to use for this projects: [netbeans](https://netbeans.org), [eclipse](https://eclipse.org), [webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm), [sublime text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [brackets](https://brackets.io), [atom](https://atom.io), [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and more that I am not familiar with.
